                                    <h4>HOW WE USE THIS INFORMATION</h4>
                                    <p>For our travelers who sign up for trips, this information is shared with our service providers so that they can provide services to you during your tour. For users of our website, this information is used to support and enhance your use of our website and its features, including pre-filling certain forms for you and keeping track of trips you have added to your wish list. Your information is never sold or traded to third parties.
                                        We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., to analyze how users (in aggregate) use our website and to improve upon its features. This data is anonymous, but may include the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the pages visited, and the referring website (if any).

                                        Wilderness Travel does contract with a number of other companies to provide necessary services for the running of our business, including “mail houses” which provide name and correct address verification, determine necessary postage and provide shipping services; “email distributers” who coordinate our eNewsletter mailings and process all the “unsubscribe” requests; airlines to book any internal flights required; and credit card processors. We provide these companies only the information they need to perform their service and choose to only work with respected providers. With the exception of airlines, these companies are prohibited from using this information for their own purposes or from sharing it with anyone other than MidAsia Routes
                                        We are not responsible for any personal information you choose to submit for posting on our blog or any other publicly accessible area of the website, including if you choose to initiate a Social Feature, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Pinterest, enabling you to “like” or “share” content to other sites or services.
                                        On rare occasions, we may provide limited mailing information to trusted non-profit organizations for purposes we believe you would support, including the American Himalayan Foundation.
                                        We reserve the right to release information to the appropriate authorities if we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or to protect the property or safety of MidAsia Routes, or any of its agents, employees, or users, or to protect the integrity of our website and data.
